  abstract = {How evolutionary forces interact to maintain genetic variation within populations has been a matter of extensive theoretical debates. While mutation and exogenous gene flow increase genetic variation, stabilizing selection and genetic drift are expected to deplete it. To date, levels of genetic variation observed in natural populations are hard to predict without accounting for other processes, such as balancing selection in heterogeneous environments. We aimed to empirically test three hypotheses: (i) admixed populations have higher quantitative genetic variation due to introgression from other gene pools, (ii) quantitative genetic variation is lower in populations from harsher environments (i.e., experiencing stronger selection), and (iii) quantitative genetic variation is higher in populations from heterogeneous environments. Using growth, phenological and functional trait data from three clonal common gardens and 33 populations (522 clones) of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), we estimated the association between the population-specific total genetic variances (i.e., among-clone variances) for these traits and ten population-specific indices related to admixture levels (estimated based on 5165 SNPs), environmental temporal and spatial heterogeneity and climate harshness. Populations experiencing colder winters showed consistently lower genetic variation for early height growth (a fitness-related trait in forest trees) in the three common gardens. Within-population quantitative genetic variation was not associated with environmental heterogeneity or population admixture for any trait. Our results provide empirical support for the potential role of natural selection in reducing genetic variation for early height growth within populations, which indirectly gives insight into the adaptive potential of populations to changing environments.},

As well as evaluating standing genetic diversity, these experiments provide an ongoing test of genetic variation against changing environmental conditions and form a vital resource for understanding how species respond to abiotic and biotic variation. Finally, quantitative assessments of phenotypic variation are essential to pair with rapidly accumulating genomic data to advance understanding of the genetic basis of trait variation, and its interaction with climatic change. We describe a multisite, population-progeny, common garden experiment of the economically and ecologically important tree species, Scots pine, collected from across its native range in Scotland and grown in three contrasting environments.

  abstract = {Local adaptation patterns have been found in many plants and animals, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of species along their range of distribution. In the next decades, global warming is predicted to induce a change in the selective pressures that drive this adaptive variation, forcing a reshuffling of the underlying adaptive allele distributions. For species with low dispersion capacity and long generation time such as trees, the rapidity of the change could impede the migration of beneficial alleles and lower their capacity to track the changing environment. Identifying the main selective pressures driving the adaptive genetic variation is thus necessary when investigating species capacity to respond to global warming. In this study, we investigate the adaptive landscape of Fagus sylvatica along a gradient of populations in the French Alps. Using a double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing approach, we identified 7,000 SNPs from 570 individuals across 36 different sites. A redundancy analysis (RDA)-derived method allowed us to identify several SNPs that were strongly associated with climatic gradients; moreover, we defined the primary selective gradients along the natural populations of F. sylvatica in the Alps. Strong effects of elevation and humidity, which contrast north-western and south-eastern site, were found and were believed to be important drivers of genetic adaptation. Finally, simulations of future genetic landscapes that used these findings allowed identifying populations at risk for F. sylvatica in the Alps, which could be helpful for future management plans.},

The genomic era has brought new tools to study this process, which was historically explored through common garden experiments. In this study, we combine genomic methods and common gardens to investigate local adaptation in red spruce and identify environmental gradients and loci involved in climate adaptation. We first use climate transfer functions to estimate the impact of climate change on seedling performance in three common gardens. We then explore the use of multivariate gene--environment association methods to identify genes underlying climate adaptation, with particular attention to the implications of conducting genome scans with and without correction for neutral population structure. This integrative approach uncovered phenotypic evidence of local adaptation to climate and identified a set of putatively adaptive genes, some of which are involved in three main adaptive pathways found in other temperate and boreal coniferous species: drought tolerance, cold hardiness, and phenology. These putatively adaptive genes segregated into two `modules' associated with different environmental gradients. This study nicely exemplifies the multivariate dimension of adaptation to climate in trees.},

In landscape genetics, ordination methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been used to detect adaptive variation based on genomic data. Taking advantage of environmental data in addition to genotype data, redundancy analysis (RDA) is another ordination approach that is useful to detect adaptive variation. This study aims at proposing a test statistic based on RDA to search for loci under selection. We compare redundancy analysis to pcadapt, which is a nonconstrained ordination method, and to a latent factor mixed model (LFMM), which is a univariate genotype--environment association method. Individual-based simulations identify evolutionary scenarios where RDA genome scans have a greater statistical power than genome scans based on PCA. By constraining the analysis with environmental variables, RDA performs better than PCA in identifying adaptive variation when selection gradients are weakly correlated with population structure. In addition, we show that if RDA and LFMM have a similar power to identify genetic markers associated with environmental variables, the RDA-based procedure has the advantage to identify the main selective gradients as a combination of environmental variables. To give a concrete illustration of RDA in population genomics, we apply this method to the detection of outliers and selective gradients on an SNP data set of Populus trichocarpa (Geraldes et al., ). The RDA-based approach identifies the main selective gradient contrasting southern and coastal populations to northern and continental populations in the north-western American coast.},

There is a growing interest in using population genomic data to help predict future disruptions to locally adaptive gene-environment associations. One motivation behind such work is to better understand how the effects of changing climate on populations' short-term fitness could vary spatially across species ranges. Here we review the current use of genomic data to predict the disruption of local adaptation across current and future climates.

  abstract = {Landscape genomics identifies how spatial and environmental factors structure the amount and distribution of genetic variation among populations. Landscape genomic analyses have been applied across diverse taxonomic groups and ecological settings, and are increasingly used to analyse datasets composed of large numbers of genomic markers and multiple environmental predictors. It is in this context that multivariate methods show their strengths. Redundancy analysis (RDA) is a constrained ordination that, in a landscape genomics framework, models linear relationships among environment predictors and genomic variation, effectively identifying covarying allele frequencies associated with the multivariate environment. RDA can be used at both individual and population levels, can include covariates to account for confounding factors and can be used to directly infer genotype--environment associations on the landscape. The modelling of both multivariate response and explanatory variables allows RDA to accommodate the genomic and environmental complexity found in nature, producing a powerful and efficient tool for landscape genomics. In this review, we outline the diverse uses of RDA in landscape genomics, including variable selection, variance partitioning, genotype--environment associations, and the calculation of adaptive indices and genomic offset. To illustrate these applications, we use a published dataset for lodgepole pine that includes genomic, phenotypic and environmental data. We provide an introduction to the statistical basis of RDA, a tutorial on its use and interpretation in landscape genomics applications, discuss limitations and provide guidelines to avoid misuse. This review and associated tutorial provide a comprehensive resource to the landscape genomics community to improve understanding of RDA as a modelling framework, and encourage the appropriate use of RDA across diverse landscape genomics applications. RDA is truly a Swiss Army Knife for landscape genomics: a multipurpose, adaptable and versatile approach to identifying, evaluating and forecasting relationships between genetic and environmental variation.},

  abstract = {Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either from the dependence of community structure on environmental variables or/and from community-based processes. In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method, and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that will better suit their needs.},

  abstract = {Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. Genotype--environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and environment. Multivariate methods, which analyse many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these data as they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods and five univariate and differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations, particularly redundancy analysis (RDA), showed a superior combination of low false-positive and high true-positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes and weak population structure tested here. The value of combining detections from different methods was variable and depended on the study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Re-analysis of genomic data from grey wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could be identified using RDA. Although additional testing is needed, this study indicates that RDA is an effective means of detecting adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation.},

Based on statistical models, these genomewide testing procedures have attracted considerable attention as tools to identify loci potentially targeted by natural selection. An important issue with PD and EA tests is that incorrect model specification can generate large numbers of false-positive associations. Spurious association may indeed arise when shared demographic history, patterns of isolation by distance, cryptic relatedness or genetic background are ignored. Recent works on PD and EA tests have widely focused on improvements of test corrections for those confounding effects. Despite significant algorithmic improvements, there is still a number of open questions on how to check that false discoveries are under control and implement test corrections, or how to combine statistical tests from multiple genome scan methods. This tutorial study provides a detailed answer to these questions. It clarifies the relationships between traditional methods based on allele frequency differentiation and EA methods and provides a unified framework for their underlying statistical tests. We demonstrate how techniques developed in the area of genomewide association studies, such as inflation factors and linear mixed models, benefit genome scan methods and provide guidelines for good practice while conducting statistical tests in landscape and population genomic applications. Finally, we highlight how the combination of several well-calibrated statistical tests can increase the power to reject neutrality, improving our ability to infer patterns of local adaptation in large population genomic data sets.},

Originating around 9,000 yr ago in the Yangtze Valley, rice diversified into temperate and tropical japonica rice during a global cooling event about 4,200 yr ago. Soon after, tropical japonica rice reached Southeast Asia, where it rapidly diversified, starting about 2,500 yr bp. The history of indica rice dispersal appears more complicated, moving into China around 2,000 yr bp. We also identify extrinsic factors that influence genome diversity, with temperature being a leading abiotic factor.

The additive genetic coefficient of variation (; mean 15\%), in Norway spruce, decreased with growth as well as site latitude. in Scots pine (mean =8.5\%) increased with southward transfer and more southerly test latitude. Additive and genotypic within-site genetic age-age correlations in Norway spruce were high, with mean rAand rGof 0.92 and 0.85, respectively. Corresponding across-sites estimates were on average lower. Genetic parameters were better expressed on favorable sites, at younger ages in Norway spruce and at older ages in Scots pine. The results imply that gain calculations should be based on different parameters in the two species. For maximizing genetic gain in the Swedish breeding program, testing times could be shorter for Norway spruce than for Scots pine.

Environment explained a substantial portion of SNP variation, independent of geographical distance, and genic SNPs were enriched for environmental associations. Further, environment-associated SNPs predicted genotype-by-environment interactions under experimental drought stress and aluminum toxicity. Our results suggest that genomic signatures of environmental adaptation may be useful for crop improvement, enhancing germplasm identification and marker-assisted selection. Together, genome-environment associations and phenotypic analyses may reveal the basis of environmental adaptation.},
