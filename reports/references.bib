  abstract = {How evolutionary forces interact to maintain genetic variation within populations has been a matter of extensive theoretical debates. While mutation and exogenous gene flow increase genetic variation, stabilizing selection and genetic drift are expected to deplete it. To date, levels of genetic variation observed in natural populations are hard to predict without accounting for other processes, such as balancing selection in heterogeneous environments. We aimed to empirically test three hypotheses: (i) admixed populations have higher quantitative genetic variation due to introgression from other gene pools, (ii) quantitative genetic variation is lower in populations from harsher environments (i.e., experiencing stronger selection), and (iii) quantitative genetic variation is higher in populations from heterogeneous environments. Using growth, phenological and functional trait data from three clonal common gardens and 33 populations (522 clones) of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), we estimated the association between the population-specific total genetic variances (i.e., among-clone variances) for these traits and ten population-specific indices related to admixture levels (estimated based on 5165 SNPs), environmental temporal and spatial heterogeneity and climate harshness. Populations experiencing colder winters showed consistently lower genetic variation for early height growth (a fitness-related trait in forest trees) in the three common gardens. Within-population quantitative genetic variation was not associated with environmental heterogeneity or population admixture for any trait. Our results provide empirical support for the potential role of natural selection in reducing genetic variation for early height growth within populations, which indirectly gives insight into the adaptive potential of populations to changing environments.},

  abstract = {Multisite common garden experiments, exposing common pools of genetic diversity to a range of environments, allow quantification of plastic and genetic components of trait variation. For tree species, such studies must be long term as they typically only express mature traits after many years. As well as evaluating standing genetic diversity, these experiments provide an ongoing test of genetic variation against changing environmental conditions and form a vital resource for understanding how species respond to abiotic and biotic variation. Finally, quantitative assessments of phenotypic variation are essential to pair with rapidly accumulating genomic data to advance understanding of the genetic basis of trait variation, and its interaction with climatic change. We describe a multisite, population-progeny, common garden experiment of the economically and ecologically important tree species, Scots pine, collected from across its native range in Scotland and grown in three contrasting environments. Phenotypic traits, including height, stem diameter and budburst were measured over 14 growing seasons from nursery to field site. The datasets presented have a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either from the dependence of community structure on environmental variables or/and from community-based processes. In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method, and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that will better suit their needs.},

  abstract = {Identifying adaptive loci can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. Genotype--environment association (GEA) methods, which identify these loci based on correlations between genetic and environmental data, are particularly promising. Univariate methods have dominated GEA, despite the high dimensional nature of genotype and environment. Multivariate methods, which analyse many loci simultaneously, may be better suited to these data as they consider how sets of markers covary in response to environment. These methods may also be more effective at detecting adaptive processes that result in weak, multilocus signatures. Here, we evaluate four multivariate methods and five univariate and differentiation-based approaches, using published simulations of multilocus selection. We found that Random Forest performed poorly for GEA. Univariate GEAs performed better, but had low detection rates for loci under weak selection. Constrained ordinations, particularly redundancy analysis (RDA), showed a superior combination of low false-positive and high true-positive rates across all levels of selection. These results were robust across the demographic histories, sampling designs, sample sizes and weak population structure tested here. The value of combining detections from different methods was variable and depended on the study goals and knowledge of the drivers of selection. Re-analysis of genomic data from grey wolves highlighted the unique, covarying sets of adaptive loci that could be identified using RDA. Although additional testing is needed, this study indicates that RDA is an effective means of detecting adaptation, including signatures of weak, multilocus selection, providing a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation.},

  abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the world's most important food crops, and is comprised largely of japonica and indica subspecies. Here, we reconstruct the history of rice dispersal in Asia using whole-genome sequences of more than 1,400 landraces, coupled with geographic, environmental, archaeobotanical and paleoclimate data. Originating around 9,000 yr ago in the Yangtze Valley, rice diversified into temperate and tropical japonica rice during a global cooling event about 4,200 yr ago. Soon after, tropical japonica rice reached Southeast Asia, where it rapidly diversified, starting about 2,500 yr bp. The history of indica rice dispersal appears more complicated, moving into China around 2,000 yr bp. We also identify extrinsic factors that influence genome diversity, with temperature being a leading abiotic factor. Reconstructing the dispersal history of rice and its climatic correlates may help identify genetic adaptations associated with the spread of a key domesticated species.},

The dataset interpolates in situ observations to a regular grid using methods developed in a previous equivalent dataset that had been made available to users since 2002 through the UK Climate Projections project (UKCIP02, UKCP09). The new dataset differs from the existing one in a number of key respects: higher spatial resolution, longer time series for some variables, improved consistency with regard to the pre-processing of station observations, the use of publicly-accessible ancillary data sources, a revised calculation sequence for some variables and improved version control. This makes for a dataset that is more internally consistent, more traceable and more reproducible. The result is a dataset of key UK climate variables of up to 1 km resolution from 1862 for monthly rainfall, 1884 for monthly temperature, 1891 for daily rainfall, 1929 for monthly sunshine and a wider set of variables with start dates from the 1960s to support the need for national climate monitoring and climate research.},

The material included seedling and clonal tests in Sweden, aged between 5 and 20~years. Multiple regression was used to explore relationships between parameter values and test environments. Results showed moderate narrow-sense heritabilities (\$\$ \{{\textbackslash}hat\{h\}{\textasciicircum}2\} \$\$: mean =0.29 in Norway spruce; mean =0.23 in Scots pine) that decreased with test site latitude for both species. In Norway spruce, \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}hat\{h\}{\textasciicircum}2\} \$\$increased with better growth and decreased with tree age, while for Scots pine, \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}hat\{h\}{\textasciicircum}2\} \$\$increased with tree age and southward transfer. The additive genetic coefficient of variation (; mean 15\%), in Norway spruce, decreased with growth as well as site latitude. in Scots pine (mean =8.5\%) increased with southward transfer and more southerly test latitude. Additive and genotypic within-site genetic age-age correlations in Norway spruce were high, with mean rAand rGof 0.92 and 0.85, respectively. Corresponding across-sites estimates were on average lower. Genetic parameters were better expressed on favorable sites, at younger ages in Norway spruce and at older ages in Scots pine. The results imply that gain calculations should be based on different parameters in the two species. For maximizing genetic gain in the Swedish breeding program, testing times could be shorter for Norway spruce than for Scots pine. The investigation showed a large variation in parameter estimates from different field experiments, highlighting the importance of testing over multiple sites.},

  abstract = {Improving environmental adaptation in crops is essential for food security under global change, but phenotyping adaptive traits remains a major bottleneck. If associations between single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles and environment of origin in crop landraces reflect adaptation, then these could be used to predict phenotypic variation for adaptive traits. We tested this proposition in the global food crop Sorghum bicolor, characterizing 1943 georeferenced landraces at 404,627 SNPs and quantifying allelic associations with bioclimatic and soil gradients. Environment explained a substantial portion of SNP variation, independent of geographical distance, and genic SNPs were enriched for environmental associations. Further, environment-associated SNPs predicted genotype-by-environment interactions under experimental drought stress and aluminum toxicity. Our results suggest that genomic signatures of environmental adaptation may be useful for crop improvement, enhancing germplasm identification and marker-assisted selection. Together, genome-environment associations and phenotypic analyses may reveal the basis of environmental adaptation.},
