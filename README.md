## REPORTS

The code (`.qmd` files) used to generate the following reports can be found in the folder `/reports`.

-   [FormattingScotsPineGenomicData.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/FormattingScotsPineGenomicData.html) Scots pine genomic data - formatting (e.g., replacing 'AA', 'AB', 'BB' etc by 0, 1, 2); filtering (based on the proportion of missing data for each SNP/individual, minor allele count and minor allele frequencies for each SNP); SNP position on the genome; imputation of missing data based on the most common allele within the family.

-   [PopulationGeneticStructureAndVariancePartioningScotsPine.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/PopulationGeneticStructureAndVariancePartioningScotsPine.html) Exploring the neutral population genetic structure in Scots pine with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and estimating the relative contribution of climate, population genetic structure and geography in explaining Scots pine genomic variation.

-   [ClimaticDataScotsPine.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/ClimaticDataScotsPine.html) Extracting and exploring climatic data at the location of the Scots pine populations.

-   [ExploringFormattingCGdata.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/ExploringFormattingCGdata.html) Formatting and exploring the dataset with phenotypic data.

-   [EstimatingPhenotypicPlasticityScotsPine.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/EstimatingPhenotypicPlasticityScotsPine.html) Variance partioning and estimating phenotypic plasticity of Scots pine populations.

-   [EstimatingNurseryEffectInverewe.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/EstimatingNurseryEffectInverewe.html) Estimating the nursery effect on height variation in 2016 and 2020 in Inverewe (FW), the field site in which trees come from three different nurseries.

-   [EstimatingEvolvabilityScotsPine.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/EstimatingEvolvabilityScotsPine.html) Estimating narrow-sense heritability, evolvability and within-family variance at the species and population level in Scots pine for height (height in 2014 and 2020). 

-   [ExploreChessCapeClimaticData.html](https://juliettearchambeau.github.io/2PinesClimateChangeVulnerability/ExploreChessCapeClimaticData.html) Extracting and visualizing the [CHESS-SCAPE climatic data](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/8194b416cbee482b89e0dfbe17c5786c) at the location of the studied populations.
